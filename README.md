# 👋 Hello, I'm Swarup Patil

I'm a full-stack web developer with a solid foundation in software engineering and a passion for building performant, scalable applications. With hands-on experience in developing full-stack solutions using the MERN stack and a background in backend and frontend development, I enjoy crafting intuitive UIs, writing clean APIs, and solving meaningful technical problems.

Previously at Jio Platforms, I worked on automating internal workflows and building modular web-based tools that improved operational efficiency. I’ve also led college-level projects, including a student portal and an AR-enabled travel log app, that gained wide adoption and user engagement.

I’m currently focused on deepening my skills in full-stack and backend engineering while actively exploring system architecture, clean API design, and real-world deployment practices.
